ABILITIES

CORE: **Leader**

FACTION: **Doctrina Imperatives**

**Battle Protocols:** At the start of the battle, if this model is leading a [KASTELAN ROBOTS](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/adeptus-mechanicus/datasheets.html#Kastelan-Robots) unit, that unit enters Aegis Protocols (see below). In your [Command phase](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#COMMAND-PHASE), if this model is leading a KASTELAN ROBOTS unit, you can select one protocol from those listed below for that unit to enter. Once a unit enters a protocol, it remains in that protocol until it enters a different one.  

*   **Protector Protocol:** Add 2 to the Attacks characteristic of ranged weapons equipped by KASTELAN ROBOT models in that unit.
*   **Conqueror Protocol:** Add 2 to the Attacks characteristic of melee weapons equipped by KASTELAN ROBOT models in that unit.
*   **Aegis Protocol:** Add 1 to the Toughness characteristic of KASTELAN ROBOT models in that unit.

UNIT COMPOSITION

*   **1 Cybernetica Datasmith**

**This model is equipped with:** Mechanicus pistol; power fist.

LEADER

This model can be attached to the following unit:

*   **[Kastelan Robots](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/adeptus-mechanicus/datasheets.html#Kastelan-Robots)**

You must attach this model to a KASTELAN ROBOTS unit, even if one or more other CYBERNETICA DATASMITH models have already been attached to it. In such cases, if that Bodyguard unit is destroyed, the Leader units attached to it become separate units with their original Starting Strengths. If you cannot attach this model to a KASTELAN ROBOTS unit, this model cannot be deployed and counts as having been destroyed during the first [battle round](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#The-Battle-Round). While attached to a KASTELAN ROBOTS unit, this model loses the INFANTRY keyword.

SERVITOR RETINUE

At the start of the [Declare Battle Formations](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Declare-Battle-Formations) step, this unit can join one other unit from your army that is being led by a [TECH-PRIEST ENGINSEER](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/adeptus-mechanicus/datasheets.html#Tech-priest-Enginseer) model (a unit cannot have more than one [SERVITORS](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/adeptus-mechanicus/datasheets.html#Servitors) unit joined to it). If it does, until the end of the battle, every model in this unit counts as being part of that Bodyguard unit, and that Bodyguard unit’s Starting Strength is increased accordingly.

Heavy

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Heavy)

Heavy weapons are amongst the biggest guns on the battlefield, but require bracing to fire at full effect and are unwieldy to bring to bear at close quarters.

Weapons with \[HEAVY\] in their profile are known as Heavy weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if the attacking model’s unit [Remained Stationary](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Remain-Stationary) this turn, add 1 to that attack’s [Hit roll](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll).  
  

*   Add 1 to Hit rolls if the bearer’s unit Remained Stationary this turn.

The BATTLELINE keyword is used in the following Adeptus Mechanicus datasheets:

Battleline

[Skitarii Rangers](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/adeptus-mechanicus/datasheets.html#Skitarii-Rangers)

[Skitarii Vanguard](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/adeptus-mechanicus/datasheets.html#Skitarii-Vanguard)

Hit Roll

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll)

When a model makes an attack, make one Hit roll for that attack by rolling one D6. If the result of the Hit roll is greater than or equal to the attack’s Ballistic Skill (BS) characteristic (if the attack is being made with a ranged weapon) or its Weapon Skill (WS) characteristic (if the attack is being made with a melee weapon), then that Hit roll is successful and scores one hit against the target unit. Otherwise, the attack fails and the [attack sequence](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Making-Attacks) ends.  
  
An unmodified Hit roll of 6 is called a Critical Hit and is always successful. An unmodified Hit roll of 1 always fails. A Hit roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.  
  

*   **Hit Roll (Ranged Attack):** A hit is scored if the D6 result equals or exceeds that attack’s BS.
*   **Hit Roll (Melee Attack):** A hit is scored if the D6 result equals or exceeds that attack’s WS.
*   **Critical Hit:** Unmodified Hit roll of 6. Always successful.
*   An unmodified Hit roll of 1 always fails.
*   A Hit roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.

Assault

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Assault)

Assault weapons fire so indiscriminately that they can be shot from the hip as warriors dash forward.

Weapons with \[ASSAULT\] in their profile are known as Assault weapons. If a unit that [Advanced](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance-Moves) this turn contains any models equipped with Assault weapons, it is still eligible to shoot in this turn’s [Shooting phase](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE). When such a unit is selected to shoot, you can only resolve attacks using Assault weapons its models are equipped with.  
  

*   Can be shot even if the bearer’s unit Advanced.

Doctrina Imperatives

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/adeptus-mechanicus/#Doctrina-Imperatives)

An Adeptus Mechanicus army marching to war is a sight both terrifying and glorious, each holy warrior a disturbing fusion of Human and machine. While the ruling Tech-Priests and their fanatical followers raise modified voices in praise of the Machine God, their Skitarii soldiery and Servitor creations are controlled by doctrina imperatives loaded by their masters to augment and adapt the warriors’ abilities.

At the start of the battle round, you can select one of the Doctrina Imperatives below. Until the end of the battle round, that Doctrina Imperative is active for your army, and all units from your army that have the Doctrina Imperatives ability gain the relevant abilities shown below.

Protector Imperative

*   Ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit have the \[HEAVY\] ability.
*   Improve the Ballistic Skill characteristic of ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit by 1.
*   Each time a melee attack targets this unit, if this unit has the BATTLELINE keyword and/or it is within 6" of one or more friendly ADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUS BATTLELINE units, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.

Conqueror Imperative

*   Ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit have the \[ASSAULT\] ability.
*   Improve the Weapon Skill characteristic of melee weapons equipped by models in this unit by 1.
*   Each time a model in this unit makes an attack, if this unit has the BATTLELINE keyword and/or it is within 6" of one or more friendly ADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUSADEPTUS MECHANICUS BATTLELINE units, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

Destroyed

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Destroyed)

Throughout a battle, models will suffer damage and be destroyed. When a model is destroyed, it is removed from the battlefield. When every model in a unit has been destroyed, that unit is destroyed.

LEADER

Mighty heroes fight at the forefront of battle.

Some CHARACTER units have ‘Leader’ listed on their datasheets. Such CHARACTER units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.  
  
During the Declare Battle Formations step, for each Leader in your army, if your army also includes one or more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.  
  
While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed, it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a CHARACTER model in that unit, even if that CHARACTER model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to CHARACTER models in that unit.  
  
Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit is no longer part of an Attached unit. It becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks.  
  
Each time the last model in a CHARACTER unit that is attached to a Bodyguard unit is destroyed and there is not another CHARACTER unit attached, that Attached unit’s Bodyguard unit is no longer part of an Attached unit. It becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks.  
  
Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.  
  

**Example:** _If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a CHARACTER unit. If you only destroy the CHARACTER unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one CHARACTER unit._

  

*   Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.
*   Attached units can only contain one Leader.
*   Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.

LONE OPERATIVE

Assassins and other covert agents are difficult to track and pinpoint in the swirling maelstrom of battle.

Unless part of an Attached unit (see Leader), this unit can only be selected as the target of a ranged attack if the attacking model is within 12".

6\. Select Warlord

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#6.-Select-Warlord)

Select one CHARACTER model from your army to be your Warlord – this will be the leader of your army – and make a note of this on your Army Roster. Your Warlord gains the WARLORD keyword.

2\. Battle-shock

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Battle-shock)

In this step, you must take a Battle-shock test for each of your units on the battlefield that is [Below Half-strength](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Below-Half-strength). To do so, roll 2D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the best Leadership characteristic in that unit, the test is passed; otherwise, the test is failed and, until the start of your next Command phase, that unit is Battle-shocked.  
  
While a unit is Battle-shocked:  

*   The [Objective Control](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Profiles) characteristic of all of its models is 0.
*   If it Falls Back, you must take a [Desperate Escape test](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Fall-Back-Moves) for every model in that unit.
*   Its controlling player cannot use [Stratagems](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Stratagems) to affect that unit.

  
Once you have taken Battle-shock tests for all of your units that require them, your Command phase ends and you progress to your [Movement phase](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE).  
  
In this step, if for any reason a unit is forced to take a Battle-shock test for being below its Starting Strength, unless otherwise stated, that unit does not also have to take a Battle-shock test for being Below Half-strength. While a unit is Battle-shocked, all models in that unit are also Battle-shocked.  
  

*   Take a Battle-shock test for each unit from your army on the battlefield that is Below Half-strength.
*   Roll 2D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the unit’s Leadership, the test is passed. Otherwise, the unit is Battle-shocked until the start of your next Command phase.
*   Battle-shocked units have an OC of 0 and their controlling player cannot use Stratagems to affect them.
*   Battle-shocked units must take Desperate Escape tests if they Fall Back.

Leadership Tests

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Leadership-Tests)

If a rule requires you to take a Leadership test for a unit, roll 2D6: if the total is greater than or equal to the best Leadership characteristic in that unit, that test is passed. Otherwise, it is failed.

Benefit of Cover

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Benefit-of-Cover)

Shattered ruins and twisted wreckage afford much-needed shelter from enemy salvoes. Even heavily armoured warriors unfazed by small arms fire are thankful for such cover when foes bring their biggest guns to bear.

Models can sometimes gain a measure of protection from [terrain features](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-Features). The rules [below](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Craters-and-Rubble) detail the conditions under which a terrain feature confers the Benefit of Cover on a model.  
  
Each time a ranged attack is allocated to a model that has the Benefit of Cover, add 1 to the [saving throw](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw) made for that attack (excluding [invulnerable saving throws](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves)). Models with a [Save characteristic](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Datasheets-1) of 3+ or better cannot have the Benefit of Cover against attacks with an Armour Penetration characteristic of 0. Multiple instances of the Benefit of Cover are not cumulative – a model cannot benefit from this rule more than once at any one time.  
  

*   **Benefit of Cover:** Add 1 to armour saving throws against ranged attacks.
*   Does not apply to models with a Save of 3+ or better against attacks with an AP of 0.
*   Multiple instances are not cumulative.

_Before selecting targets for this weapon, select one of its profiles to make attacks with._

Blast

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Blast)

High-explosives can fell several warriors in a single blast, but firing them where your comrades will get caught in the ensuing detonation is simply unwise.

Weapons with \[BLAST\] in their profile are known as Blast weapons, and they make a random number of attacks. Each time you determine how many attacks are made with a Blast weapon, add 1 to the result for every five models that were in the target unit when you selected it as the target (rounding down). Blast weapons can never be used to make attacks against a unit that is within Engagement Range of one or more units from the attacking model’s army (including its own unit).  
  

**Example:** If a weapon with the \[BLAST\] ability and an Attacks characteristic of 2D6 targets a unit that contains 11 models, and the roll to determine how many attacks are made is a 9, a total of 11 attacks would be made against that unit.

  

*   Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic for every five models in the target unit (rounding down).
*   Can never be used against a target that is within Engagement Range of any units from the attacking model’s army (including its own).

Melta

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Melta)

Melta weapons are powerful heat rays whose fury is magnified at close range.

Weapons with \[MELTA X\] in their profile are known as Melta weapons. Each time an attack made with such a weapon targets a unit within half that weapon’s range, that attack’s Damage characteristic is increased by the amount denoted by ‘x’.  
  

**Example:** A model targets a unit that is within half range of a weapon with a Damage characteristic of D6 and the \[MELTA 2\] ability. If that attack inflicts damage on the target, it inflicts D6+2 damage.

  

*   \[MELTA X\]: Increase the Damage by ‘x’ when targeting units within half range.

Anti

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Anti)

Certain weapons are the bane of a particular foe.

Weapons with \[ANTI-KEYWORD X+\] in their profile are known as Anti weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon against a target with the keyword after the word ‘Anti-’, an unmodified [Wound roll](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll) of ‘x+’ scores a [Critical Wound](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll).  
  

**Example:** An attack made with an \[ANTI-VEHICLE 4+\] weapon will score a Critical Wound against – and so successfully wound – a VEHICLE unit on an unmodified Wound roll of 4+, while an attack made with an \[ANTI-PSYKER 2+\] weapon will score a Critical Wound against – and so successfully wound – a PSYKER unit on an unmodified Wound roll of 2+.

  

*   \[ANTI-KEYWORD X+\]: An unmodified Wound roll of ‘x+’ against a target with the matching keyword scores a Critical Wound.

Devastating Wounds

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Devastating-Wounds)

Weapons with \[DEVASTATING WOUNDS\] in their profile are known as Devastating Wounds weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if that attack scores a [Critical Wound](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll), no [saving throw](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw) of any kind can be made against that attack (including [invulnerable saving throws](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves)). Such attacks are only allocated to models after all other attacks made by the attacking unit have been allocated and resolved. After that attack is allocated and after any modifiers are applied, it inflicts a number of [mortal wounds](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds) on the target equal to the Damage characteristic of that attack, instead of inflicting damage normally.  
  

**Example:** An attack made with a Devastating Wounds weapon with a Damage characteristic of 2 scores a Critical Wound. Instead of allocating the attack and making saving throws normally, the target suffers 2 mortal wounds.

  

*   A Critical Wound inflicts mortal wounds equal to the weapon’s Damage characteristic, instead of any normal damage.

Extra Attacks

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Extra-Attacks)

Some warriors ride to battle atop trusty mounts that gore and trample nearby foes. Others wield combat weapons that deliver a frenzy of additional blows.

Weapons with \[EXTRA ATTACKS\] in their profile are known as Extra Attacks weapons. Each time the bearer of one or more Extra Attacks weapons fights, it makes attacks with each of the Extra Attacks melee weapons it is equipped with and it makes attacks with one of the melee weapons it is equipped with that does not have the \[EXTRA ATTACKS\] ability (if any). The number of attacks made with an Extra Attacks weapon cannot be modified by other rules, unless that weapon’s name is explicitly specified in that rule.  
  

*   The bearer can attack with this weapon in addition to any other weapons it can make attacks with.

Attached Units

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Attached-Units)

Some CHARACTER units have the [Leader](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Normal-Moves) ability, which lets them merge with other units (known as Bodyguard units) to form an Attached unit.  
  
The [Starting Strength](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Starting-Strength) of an Attached unit is equal to the combined Starting Strengths of all of its units (i.e. the number of models in the Leader unit added to the number of models in the Bodyguard unit). If either the Leader unit or the Bodyguard unit in an Attached unit is [destroyed](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Destroyed), the Starting Strength of the remaining unit is changed to be equal to its original Starting Strength.  
  

**Example:** A Primaris Captain (Starting Strength 1) is attached to a unit of Intercessors (Starting Strength 5). This Attached unit has a Starting Strength of 6. If all the Intercessors are destroyed, the remaining Primaris Captain would revert to having a Starting Strength of 1.

  
For the purposes of rules that are triggered when a unit is destroyed, such rules are still triggered when one of the individual units that made up an Attached unit is destroyed (the Leader or the Bodyguard unit).  
  

**Example:** If a rule awards you with 1VP each time an enemy unit is destroyed, and you target an Attached unit, you would gain 1VP if the Bodyguard unit is destroyed and 1VP if the Leader unit is destroyed (for a total of 2VP).

BATTLEFIELD COMMAND

1CP

Boarding Actions – Strategic Ploy Stratagem

The commander's authoritative tone cuts through the din of battle, guiding the actions of nearby troops.

**WHEN:** Start or end of any phase.  
  
**TARGET:** One Leader unit from your army and one friendly Bodyguard unit within 6" of it that it could normally be attached to.  
  
**EFFECT:** Select one of your Leader unit’s [Leader abilities](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/boarding-action-rules/#Leader-Abilities). Until the start of your next [Command phase](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#COMMAND-PHASE), that Bodyguard unit is treated as being led by that Leader unit for the purposes of that Leader ability.  
  
**RESTRICTIONS:** Once you target a unit with this Stratagem, that unit cannot be targeted with it again until your next Command phase.

Wound Roll

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll)

Each time an attack scores a hit against a target unit, make a Wound roll for that attack by rolling one D6 to see if that attack successfully wounds the target unit. The result required is determined by comparing the attack’s Strength (S) characteristic with the target’s Toughness (T) characteristic, as shown below.  
  

**WOUND ROLL**

**ATTACK’S STRENGTH VS TARGET’S TOUGHNESS**

**D6 RESULT REQUIRED**

Strength is TWICE (or more than twice) the Toughness.

**

![](Ad%20Mech%20Datasheets_files/d2.png)

+



**

Strength is GREATER than the Toughness.

**

![](Ad%20Mech%20Datasheets_files/d3.png)

+



**

Strength is EQUAL to the Toughness.

**

![](Ad%20Mech%20Datasheets_files/d4.png)

+



**

Strength is LESS than the Toughness.

**

![](Ad%20Mech%20Datasheets_files/d5.png)

+



**

Strength is HALF (or less than half) the Toughness.

**

![](Ad%20Mech%20Datasheets_files/d6.png)

+



**

  
If the result of the Wound roll is greater than or equal to the required number shown in the table above, then that Wound roll is successful and scores one wound against the target unit. Otherwise, the attack fails and the [attack sequence](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Making-Attacks) ends.  
  
An unmodified Wound roll of 6 is called a Critical Wound and is always successful. An unmodified Wound roll of 1 always fails. A Wound roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.  
  

*   **Critical Wound:** Unmodified Wound roll of 6. Always successful.
*   An unmodified Wound roll of 1 always fails.
*   A Wound roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.

Saving Throw

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw)

The player controlling the target unit then makes one saving throw. By default, this will be an armour saving throw using their model’s Save (Sv) characteristic, but some models have [invulnerable saves](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves) that can be used instead (see below). To make an armour saving throw, roll one D6, then modify the result by the Armour Penetration (AP) characteristic of the attack. For example, if the attack has an AP of -1, then 1 is subtracted from the saving throw.  
  
If the result is greater than or equal to the Save characteristic of the model the attack was allocated to, then that saving throw is successful and the [attack sequence](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Making-Attacks) ends. Otherwise, that saving throw fails and that model [suffers damage](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#5.-Inflict-Damage).  
  
An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails. A saving throw can never be improved by more than +1.  
  

*   **Saving Throw:** Roll one D6 and modify by the attack’s AP. If the result is less than the Save of the model being rolled for, the saving throw is failed and that model suffers damage. Otherwise, that attack is saved.
*   An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails.
*   A saving throw can never be improved by more than +1.

Advance Moves

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance-Moves)

When a unit Advances, make an Advance roll for that unit by rolling one D6. Add the result in inches to the Move characteristic of each model in that unit until the end of the phase. Each model in that unit can then make an Advance move by moving a distance in inches less than or equal to this total, but no model can be moved within [Engagement Range](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Engagement-Range) of enemy models. A unit cannot shoot or [declare a charge](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#CHARGE-PHASE) in the same turn that it Advanced.  
  

*   **Advance Move:** Models move up to M+D6".
*   Cannot move within Engagement Range of any enemy models.
*   Units that Advance cannot shoot or charge this turn.

Charging with a Unit

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit)

Once you have selected an eligible unit to declare a charge, you must select one or more enemy units within 12" of it as the targets of that charge. The targets of a charge do not need to be visible to the charging unit.  
  
You then make a Charge roll for the charging unit by rolling 2D6. The result is the maximum number of inches each model in that unit can be moved if a Charge move is possible. For a Charge move to be possible, the Charge roll must be sufficient to enable the charging unit to end that move:  

*   Within [Engagement Range](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Engagement-Range) of every unit that you selected as a target of the charge.
*   Without moving within Engagement Range of any enemy units that were not a target of the charge.
*   In [Unit Coherency](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Unit-Coherency).

If any of these conditions cannot be met, the charge fails and no models in the charging unit move this phase. Otherwise, the charge is successful and the models in the charging unit make a Charge move – move each model a distance in inches up to the result of the Charge roll. When doing so, each model in the charging unit must end its Charge move closer to one of the units selected as a target of its charge. If you can also move a charging model so that it ends its Charge move in base-to-base contact with one or more enemy models while still enabling the charging unit to end its move satisfying all of the conditions above, you must do so. The controlling player chooses the order in which to move their models.  
  

*   **Charge Roll:** 2D6".
*   Targets of a charge must be within 12" but do not need to be visible.
*   If the distance rolled is insufficient to move within Engagement Range of all targets while maintaining Unit Coherency, the charge fails.
*   Cannot move within Engagement Range of any unit that was not a target of the charge.
*   If the charge is successful, each model makes a Charge move less than or equal to the Charge roll, and must move into base-to-base contact with an enemy model if possible.

Fall Back Moves

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Fall-Back-Moves)

When a unit Falls Back, each model in that unit can make a Fall Back move by moving a distance in inches less than or equal to its Move characteristic, and when doing so you can move it within [Engagement Range](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Engagement-Range) of enemy models, provided it does not end that move within Engagement Range of any enemy models – if this is not possible, that unit cannot Fall Back.  
  
A unit cannot shoot or declare a charge in the same turn that it Fell Back.  
  
Desperate Escape Tests  
Unlike when making other types of move, models can move over enemy models when making a Fall Back move as if those enemy models were not there, but you must take a Desperate Escape test for each model that will do so (excluding models that are TITANIC or can [FLY](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Flying)) before any models in that unit are moved. In addition, if a unit is [Battle-shocked](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Battle-shock) when it is selected to Fall Back, you must take a Desperate Escape test for every model in that unit before any are moved.  
  

Each time you take a Desperate Escape test for a model, roll one D6. For each roll of 1-2, one model from the unit that is Falling Back is [destroyed](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Destroyed) (selected by you). The same model can only ever trigger one Desperate Escape test per phase.  
  

*   **Fall Back Move:** Models move up to M".
*   Units that Fall Back cannot shoot or declare a charge in the same turn.
*   Models can move over enemy models when Falling Back, but you must take Desperate Escape tests for them before they do so (excluding models that are TITANIC or can FLY).
*   If a Battle-shocked unit is selected to Fall Back, take a Desperate Escape test for every model in that unit.
*   **Desperate Escape Test:** Roll one D6. On a 1-2, one model from that unit is destroyed.

Hazardous

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Hazardous)

Weapons powered by unstable and dangerous energy sources pose a substantial risk to the wielder every time they are used.

Weapons with \[HAZARDOUS\] in their profile are known as Hazardous weapons. Each time a unit is selected to shoot or fight, after that unit has resolved all of its attacks, for each Hazardous weapon that targets were selected for when resolving those attacks, that unit must take one Hazardous test. To do so, roll one D6: on a 1, that test is failed. For each failed test you must resolve the following sequence (resolve each failed test one at a time):  

*   If possible, select one model in that unit that has lost one or more wounds and is equipped with one or more Hazardous weapons.
*   Otherwise, if possible, select one model in that unit (excluding CHARACTER models) equipped with one or more Hazardous weapons.
*   Otherwise, select one CHARACTER model in that unit equipped with one or more Hazardous weapons.

If a model was selected, that unit suffers 3 [mortal wounds](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds) and when allocating those mortal wounds, they must be allocated to the selected model.  
If a unit from a player’s army is selected as the target of the [Fire Overwatch](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/test_/#%D0%A1%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0) Stratagem in their opponent’s [Charge phase](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#CHARGE-PHASE), any mortal wounds inflicted by Hazardous tests are allocated after the charging unit has ended its Charge move.  
  

**Example:** A unit of five models make five attacks with ranged weapons with the \[HAZARDOUS\] ability. After the unit has finished shooting, its controlling player rolls five D6. One of the results is a 1, and so one of those models suffers 3 mortal wounds.

  

*   After a unit shoots or fights, roll one Hazardous test (one D6) for each Hazardous weapon used. For each 1, a model equipped with a hazardous weapon suffers 3 mortal wounds, that must be allocated to the selected model.

In addition, attacks made with that weapon can be allocated to models that are not visible to the attacking model.

Engagement Range

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Engagement-Range)

Engagement Range represents the zone of threat that models present to their enemies. While a model is within 1" horizontally and 5" vertically of an enemy model, those models – and their units – are within Engagement Range of each other.  
  
Models cannot be set up or end a [Normal](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Normal-Moves), [Advance](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance-Moves) or [Fall Back move](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Fall-Back-Moves) within Engagement Range of any enemy models. If for any reason a model cannot meet this condition, that model is [destroyed](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Destroyed).  
  

*   **Engagement Range:** Within 1" horizontally and 5" vertically.

**EFFECT:** Your unit fights next.

Re-rolls

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Re-rolls)

Some rules allow you to re-roll a dice roll, which means you get to roll some or all of the dice again. If a rule allows you to re-roll a dice roll that was made by adding several dice together (e.g. 2D6, 3D6, etc.) then, unless otherwise stated, you must re-roll all of those dice again.  
  
You can never re-roll a dice more than once, and re-rolls happen before modifiers (if any) are applied. Rules that refer to the value of an ‘unmodified’ dice roll are referring to the dice result after any re-rolls, but before any modifiers are applied.  
  

*   **Unmodified Dice:** the result after re-rolls, but before any modifiers.
*   A dice can never be re-rolled more than once.
*   You must re-roll all dice if several need adding together (e.g. 2D6).
*   Re-rolls are applied before any modifiers.

You can only use this Stratagem once per turn.

DEEP STRIKE

Some units make their way to battle via tunnelling, teleportation, high-altitude descent or other extraordinary means that allow them to appear suddenly in the thick of the fighting.

During the Declare Battle Formations step, if every model in a unit has this ability, you can set it up in Reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models. If a unit with the Deep Strike ability arrives from Strategic Reserves, the controlling player can choose for that unit to be set up either using the rules for Strategic Reserves or using the Deep Strike ability.  

*   Unit can be set up in Reserves instead of on the battlefield.
*   Unit can be set up in your Reinforcements step, more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models.

Mortal Wounds

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds)

Some attacks are so powerful that no armour or force field can withstand their fury.

Some rules inflict mortal wounds on units. Each time mortal wounds are inflicted on a unit, each of those mortal wounds inflicts one point of damage to that unit, and they are always applied one at a time. Each mortal wound is allocated to a model in the same manner as allocating an attack. Excess damage from mortal wounds is not lost if the damage can be allocated to another model. Instead, keep allocating damage to another model in the target unit until either all the damage has been allocated or the target unit is destroyed.  
  
If an attack inflicts mortal wounds in addition to any normal damage, do not make a [Wound roll](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll) or [saving throw](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw) (including [invulnerable saving throws](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves)) against those mortal wounds. If those mortal wounds are inflicted by an attack that has the [\[PRECISION\]](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Precision) ability, the attacking model’s controlling player can allocate those mortal wounds to a CHARACTER model in that unit.  
  
If mortal wounds are being inflicted as a result of the [\[HAZARDOUS\]](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Hazardous) ability or by an attack with the [\[DEVASTATING WOUNDS\]](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Devastating-Wounds) ability that scored a [Critical Wound](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll), each time those mortal wounds are allocated to a model, if that model is destroyed as a result of those mortal wounds, the remaining mortal wounds from that attack are lost, just as with a normal attack.  
  
If, when a unit is selected to shoot or fight, one or more of its attacks can inflict mortal wounds on the target, resolve any normal damage inflicted by the attacking unit’s attacks on that target before inflicting any mortal wounds on that target. If an attack inflicts mortal wounds in addition to any normal damage, but the normal damage is subsequently saved, the target unit still suffers those mortal wounds, as described above.  
  

*   Each mortal wound inflicted on a unit causes one model in that unit to lose one wound.
*   Unless the source of the mortal wounds is the \[HAZARDOUS\] ability or an attack with the \[DEVASTATING WOUNDS\] ability, damage from mortal wounds is not lost if it can be allocated to another model.
*   No saving throws can be made against mortal wounds.
*   Mortal wounds inflicted by attacks always apply after any normal damage, even if that damage was saved.

Feel No Pain

FEEL NO PAIN

Some warriors refuse to be laid low, even by what should be fatal wounds.

Some models have ‘Feel No Pain x+’ listed in their abilities. Each time a model with this ability suffers damage and so would lose a wound (including wounds lost due to mortal wounds), roll one D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the number denoted by ‘x’, that wound is ignored and is not lost. If a model has more than one Feel No Pain ability, you can only use one of those abilities each time that model suffers damage and so would lose a wound.  
  

*   **Feel No Pain x+:** Each time this model would lose a wound, roll one D6: if the result equals or exceeds ‘x’, that wound is not lost.

Invulnerable Saves

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves)

Whether shielded by force fields, enveloped in mystical energies or simply possessed of preternatural senses and lightning-fast reflexes, some warriors are protected by more than mere physical armour.

Some models have an invulnerable save listed on their [datasheet](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Datasheets-1). Each time an attack is allocated to a model with an invulnerable save, the controlling player must choose to use either that model’s Save characteristic or its invulnerable save, but not both. If a model has more than one invulnerable save, it can only use one of them – choose which it will use.  
  
Unlike armour saving throws (which use a model’s Save characteristic), invulnerable saving throws are never modified by an attack’s Armour Penetration characteristic, but otherwise follow the normal rules for [saving throws](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw).  
  

*   **Invulnerable Save:** Never modified by an attack’s AP.
*   The controlling player can choose to use either a model’s invulnerable save or its Save characteristic.

**TARGET:** One CULT MECHANICUS unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.  
  
**EFFECT:** Until the end of the phase, each time a CULT MECHANICUS model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6: on a 4+, do not remove it from play. The destroyed model can fight after the attacking model’s unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.

Objective Markers

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Objective-Markers)

Objective markers represent objects of tactical or strategic import that both sides are attempting to secure, such as valuable artefacts, vital supplies or communications nodes. If a mission uses objective markers, it will state where they are located on the battlefield. These can be represented using any suitable marker, but we recommend using round markers that are 40mm in diameter.  
  
When setting objective markers up on the battlefield, place them so they are centred on the point specified by the mission. When measuring distances to and from objective markers, measure to and from the closest part of them. Models can move over objective markers as if they were not there, but they cannot end a move on top of an objective marker.  
  
At the start of the battle, each objective marker on the battlefield is said to be contested, and so is not controlled by either player. To control an objective marker, a player will first need to move models within range of it. A model is within range of an objective marker if it is within 3" horizontally and 5" vertically of that objective marker.  
  
Every model has an Objective Control (OC) characteristic listed on its datasheet. To determine a player’s Level of Control over an objective marker, add together the OC characteristics of all the models from that player’s army that are within range of that objective marker. A player will control an objective marker at the end of any phase or turn if their Level of Control over it is greater than their opponent’s. If both players have the same Level of Control over an objective marker, that objective marker is contested.  
  

*   A model is within range of an objective marker if within 3" horizontally and 5" vertically.
*   **Level of Control:** Add together the OC characteristics of all of a player’s models within range of the objective marker.
*   An objective marker is controlled by the player with the highest Level of Control over it (in a tie, it is contested).
*   Models cannot end a move on top of an objective marker.

**EFFECT:** Until the start of your next Command phase, that objective marker is also considered to be one of your Acquisition objective markers for all rules purposes.

Consolidate

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#3.-Consolidate)

After a unit has finished making all of its melee attacks, it Consolidates. Each time a unit Consolidates, you can move each model in that unit that is not already in base-to-base contact with an enemy model up to 3" – this is a Consolidation move. For a Consolidation to be possible, a unit must be able to end these moves within [Engagement Range](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Engagement-Range) of one or more enemy units and in [Unit Coherency](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Unit-Coherency). If these conditions cannot be met, then each model in that unit can instead make a Consolidation move towards the closest [objective marker](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Objective-Markers), but only if, after doing so, that unit is within range of that objective marker and in Unit Coherency. If these conditions also cannot be met, no models in the unit can make Consolidation moves this phase and that unit’s fight ends.  
  
If a unit can end its Consolidation within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, then each time one of its models makes a Consolidation move, it must end that move closer to the closest enemy model. If it can also end that move in base-to-base contact with one or more enemy models while still satisfying all of the conditions above, it must do so. The controlling player chooses the order in which to move their models.  
  

*   **Consolidation Move:** Up to 3".
*   Every model that moves must end closer to the closest enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with an enemy model if possible. The unit must end in Unit Coherency and within Engagement Range of at least one enemy unit if possible.
*   If the above is not possible, each model can move towards the closest objective marker, but this must result in the unit being within range of it and in Unit Coherency.
*   If the above is also not possible, no models can Consolidate.

The number of models a unit contains when it is added to your army is known as its Starting Strength.

Pistol

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Pistol)

Pistols can be wielded even at point-blank range.

Weapons with \[PISTOL\] in their profile are known as Pistols. If a unit contains any models equipped with Pistols, that unit is eligible to shoot in its controlling player’s [Shooting phase](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE) even while it is within [Engagement Range](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Engagement-Range) of one or more enemy units. When such a unit is selected to shoot, it can only resolve attacks using its Pistols and can only target one of the enemy units it is within Engagement Range of. In such circumstances, a Pistol can target an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit.  
  
If a model is equipped with one or more Pistols, unless it is a MONSTER or VEHICLE model, it can either shoot with its Pistols or with all of its other ranged weapons. Declare whether such a model will shoot with its Pistols or its other ranged weapons before selecting targets.  
  

*   Can be shot even if the bearer’s unit is within Engagement Range of enemy units, but must target one of those enemy units.
*   Cannot be shot alongside any other non-Pistol weapon (except by a MONSTER or VEHICLE).

**EFFECT:** Until the end of the phase, both of those units have the Stealth ability and the Benefit of Cover.

Embark

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Embark)

If a unit makes a [Normal](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Normal-Moves), [Advance](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance-Moves) or [Fall Back move](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Fall-Back-Moves), and every model in that unit ends that move within 3" of a friendly [TRANSPORT](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Transports) model, they can embark within it. A unit cannot embark if it has already [disembarked](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Disembark) from a TRANSPORT model in the same phase. Remove the unit from the battlefield and place it to one side – it is now embarked within that TRANSPORT model. Unless otherwise stated, units cannot do anything or be affected in any way while they are embarked.  
  

*   A unit can embark within a friendly TRANSPORT if all of its models end a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move within 3" of that TRANSPORT.
*   A unit cannot embark and disembark in the same phase.

Transport Capacity

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Transport-Capacity)

All TRANSPORT models have a transport capacity listed on their [datasheet](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Datasheets-1). This determines the type and maximum number of friendly models that can [embark](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Embark) within them.  
  
Units can start the battle embarked within a TRANSPORT model instead of being set up separately – declare which units are embarked within a TRANSPORT model before you set it up.  
  

FIRING DECK

Some transports have firing hatches, ports or platforms from which embarked passengers can shoot.

Some TRANSPORT models have ‘Firing Deck x’ listed in their abilities. Each time such a model is selected to shoot in the [Shooting phase](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE), you can select up to ‘x’ models embarked within it whose units have not already shot this phase. Then, for each of those embarked models, you can select one ranged weapon that embarked model is equipped with (excluding weapons with the \[ONE SHOT\] ability). Until that TRANSPORT model has resolved all of its attacks, it counts as being equipped with all of the weapons you selected in this way, in addition to its other weapons. Until the end of the phase, those selected models’ units are not eligible to shoot.  
  

*   **Firing Deck ‘x’:** Each time this TRANSPORT shoots, select one weapon (excluding weapons with the \[ONE SHOT\] ability) from up to ‘x’ models embarked within it whose units have not shot this phase; this TRANSPORT counts as being equipped with those weapons as well. Until the end of the phase, those selected models’ units are not eligible to shoot.

Some weapons strike in a flurry of blows, tearing the foe apart with relentless ferocity.

Weapons with \[SUSTAINED HITS X\] in their profile are known as Sustained Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if a [Critical Hit](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll) is rolled, that attack scores a number of additional hits on the target as denoted by ‘x’.  
  

**Example:** A model makes an attack with a melee weapon with the \[SUSTAINED HITS 2\] ability. If the [Hit roll](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll) is an unmodified 6 (a Critical Hit), then that attack scores a total of 3 hits on the target (1 from the successful Hit roll of 6, and 2 from the \[SUSTAINED HITS 2\] ability).

  

*   \[SUSTAINED HITS X\]: Each Critical Hit scores ‘x’ additional hits on the target.

Such a disembarking unit cannot choose to [Remain Stationary](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Remain-Stationary).  
  
Units that disembark from a TRANSPORT model that made a Normal move this phase count as having made a Normal move themselves; they cannot move further during this phase. Such a unit also cannot declare a charge in the same turn, but can otherwise act normally in the remainder of the turn.  
  
Units cannot disembark from a TRANSPORT model that either [Advanced](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance-Moves) or [Fell Back](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Fall-Back-Moves) this turn.  
  

*   Units that start your Movement phase embarked within a TRANSPORT can disembark this phase, provided their TRANSPORT has not Advanced or Fallen Back.
*   If a unit disembarks before its TRANSPORT moves, it can act normally.
*   If a unit disembarks after its TRANSPORT moves, it cannot move or charge this turn, but can otherwise act normally.
*   Disembarking units must be set up wholly within 3" of their TRANSPORT and not within Engagement Range of any enemy models (or the unit cannot disembark).
*   Units that disembark this turn cannot Remain Stationary.

DEADLY DEMISE

From detonating ammo stores to corrosive innards or frenzied death throes, some targets are deadly even in defeat.

Some models have ‘Deadly Demise x’ listed in their abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a [TRANSPORT](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Transports), roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by ‘x’ (if this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6").  
  

**Example:** A TRANSPORT model with the Deadly Demise D3 ability is destroyed. Before any models disembark and before removing it from play, its controlling player rolls one D6, getting a 6. There are three units within 6" of that destroyed model, so its controlling player rolls one D3 for each of them, inflicting mortal wounds accordingly.

After both players have deployed their armies, you can select up to three SKITARII INFANTRY units from your army and redeploy all of those units. When doing so, any of those units can be placed into [Strategic Reserves](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Strategic-Reserves), regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves.

INFILTRATORS

Many armies employ reconnaissance units who can sit concealed, waiting for the right moment to strike.

During deployment, if every model in a unit has this ability, then when you set it up, it can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from the enemy deployment zone and all enemy models.

SCOUTS

Scouts form the vanguard of many armies. Unnoticed by the enemy, they range ahead of the main force.

Some units have ‘Scouts x"’ listed in their abilities. If every model in a unit has this ability, then at the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, it can make a Normal move of up to x", with the exception that, while making that move, the distance moved by each model in that unit can be greater than that model's Move characteristic, as long as it is not greater than x".  
  
DEDICATED TRANSPORT models can make use of any Scouts x" ability listed in their abilities, or a Scouts x" ability that a unit that starts the battle embarked within that DEDICATED TRANSPORT model has (provided only models with this ability are embarked within that DEDICATED TRANSPORT model), regardless of how that embarked unit gained this ability (e.g. listed in their abilities, conferred by an Enhancement or by an attached CHARACTER, etc.).  
  
A unit that moves using this ability must end that move more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models. If both players have units that can do this, the player who is taking the first turn moves their units first.  
  

**Example:** A unit has the Scouts 6" ability. At the start of the first battle round, the controlling player can make a Normal move with that unit of up to 6".

  

*   **Scouts x":** Unit can make a Normal move of up to x" before the first turn begins.

Rapid Fire

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Rapid-Fire)

Rapid fire weapons are capable of long-ranged precision shots or controlled bursts at nearby targets.

Weapons with \[RAPID FIRE X\] in their profile are known as Rapid Fire weapons. Each time such a weapon targets a unit within half that weapon’s range, the Attacks characteristic of that weapon is increased by the amount denoted by ‘x’.  
  

**Example:** A model targets a unit that is within half range of a weapon with an Attacks characteristic of 1 and the \[RAPID FIRE 1\] ability. That weapon therefore makes two attacks at the target, and you make two [Hit rolls](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll).

  

*   \[RAPID FIRE X\]: Increase the Attacks by ‘x’ when targeting units within half range.

FIRING DECK

Some transports have firing hatches, ports or platforms from which embarked passengers can shoot.

Some TRANSPORT models have ‘Firing Deck x’ listed in their abilities. Each time such a model is selected to shoot in the [Shooting phase](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE), you can select up to ‘x’ models embarked within it whose units have not already shot this phase. Then, for each of those embarked models, you can select one ranged weapon that embarked model is equipped with (excluding weapons with the \[ONE SHOT\] ability). Until that TRANSPORT model has resolved all of its attacks, it counts as being equipped with all of the weapons you selected in this way, in addition to its other weapons. Until the end of the phase, those selected models’ units are not eligible to shoot.  
  

*   **Firing Deck ‘x’:** Each time this TRANSPORT shoots, select one weapon (excluding weapons with the \[ONE SHOT\] ability) from up to ‘x’ models embarked within it whose units have not shot this phase; this TRANSPORT counts as being equipped with those weapons as well.

HOVER

Some aircraft can use vectored thrusters or anti-grav technology to hover over the battlefield, the better to hunt their prey or deploy embarked troops.

Some [AIRCRAFT](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Aircraft) models have ‘Hover’ listed in their abilities. When you are instructed to [Declare Battle Formations](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Declare-Battle-Formations), before doing anything else, you must first declare which models from your army with this ability will be in Hover mode.  
  
If a model is in Hover mode, then until the end of the battle, its Move characteristic is changed to 20", it loses the AIRCRAFT keyword and it loses all associated rules for being an AIRCRAFT model. Models in Hover mode do not start the battle in [Reserves](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Reinforcements), but you can choose to place them into [Strategic Reserves](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Strategic-Reserves) following the normal rules if you wish.

Note this also means that MONSTER and VEHICLE models that can FLY can be moved over other MONSTER and VEHICLE models when making such a move. However, models that can FLY cannot end their move on top of any other models or within Engagement Range of any enemy models.  
  
When a model that can FLY starts or ends a move on a [terrain feature](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-Features-1), instead of measuring the path it has moved across the battlefield, you instead measure its path ‘through the air’, as shown in the diagram below.  
  

*   FLY models can move over enemy models when they make a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move.
*   FLY models that start or end a move on a terrain feature measure distance moved through the air when they make a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move.

GRENADE

1CP

Core – Wargear Stratagem

Priming their hand-held projectiles, these warriors draw back and hurl death into the enemy’s midst.

**WHEN:** Your [Shooting phase](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE).  
  
**TARGET:** One GRENADES unit from your army (excluding units that Advanced, Fell Back or have shot this turn) that is not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.  
  
**EFFECT:** Select one GRENADES model in your unit and one enemy unit that is not within Engagement Range of any units from your army and is within 8" of and visible to your GRENADES model. Roll six D6: for each 4+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

Indirect Fire

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Indirect-Fire)

Indirect fire weapons launch munitions over or around intervening obstacles – nowhere is safe from their fury.

Weapons with \[INDIRECT FIRE\] in their profile are known as Indirect Fire weapons, and attacks can be made with them even if the target is not visible to the attacking model. These attacks can destroy enemy models in a target unit even though none may have been visible to the attacking unit when you selected that target.  
  
If no models in a target unit are visible to the attacking unit when you select that target, then each time a model in the attacking unit makes an attack against that target using an Indirect Fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s [Hit roll](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll), an unmodified Hit roll of 1-3 always fails, and the target has the [Benefit of Cover](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Benefit-of-Cover) against that attack. Weapons with the \[TORRENT\] ability cannot be fired using the \[INDIRECT FIRE\] ability.  
  

**Example:** An enemy unit is targeted by an attacking model equipped with a weapon with the \[INDIRECT FIRE\] ability. No models in the target unit are visible to the attacking model, so when resolving the attacks made with that weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll an unmodified Hit roll of 1-3 always fails, and each time an attack is allocated to a model in the target unit, it has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

  

*   Can target and make attacks against units that are not visible to the attacking unit.
*   If no models are visible in a target unit when it is selected, then when making an attack against that target with an Indirect Fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll, an unmodified Hit roll of 1-3 always fails, and the target has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

Lance

[

](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Lance)

Lance weapons are deadly on the charge.

Weapons with \[LANCE\] in their profile are known as Lance weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if the bearer made a [Charge move](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit) this turn, add 1 to that attack’s [Wound roll](http://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll).
